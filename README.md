# workday-planner

My motivation today is create a work day scheduler that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

* The work day scheduler should have the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* The timeblocks for standard business hours are displayed
* Each timeblocks for the day is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future 
* The timeblocks can be edited to enter an event
* The event entered must be able to be saved through a save button
* The text for the event is saved in the local storage
* When refresh the page the saved events persist
